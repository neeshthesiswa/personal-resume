MOTHER
</p>


<p>
My mother is a police officer serving at the Petaling Police Station. She is a firm and highly disciplined woman who always puts rules and duty first. However, behind her strict exterior lies a warm heart,  her kindness and loving nature are inseparable from who she truly is.

FATHER
</p>


<p>
My father is also a police officer. He has a humorous, kind-hearted, and easygoing personality. However, when on duty, he becomes a very firm and responsible individual, fully committed to his role and responsibilities.
