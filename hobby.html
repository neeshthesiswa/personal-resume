I have several hobbies. The first is playing online games with my friends, as it helps relieve stress and allows me to spend time with friends who live far away. Besides that, I also enjoy photography, especially capturing scenic views. It brings me a sense of calm and helps me appreciate the beauty that has been bestowed upon us.
